Onna Model by White Dragon  2/28/99 <rapidly approaching 2/29/99 >

Just unzip into the players/onna directory and have fun.

A brand new model of a cute anime style character.  I think this is
the first player model to have a resized biped <thus allowing the
shoulders to be in the right place> Hope you all enjoy it. I also
changed one death sequence just for fun! :)

I didn't add in team colors in this version. I hope to do it in my next model.

If any of you are wondering the kanji on the front of her shirt 
Is onna, <means woman>.
