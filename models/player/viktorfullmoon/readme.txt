Viktor Full Moon for Sven Co-op

Port by Dragon Denton
Original model by Hi Rez Studios


First time I have worked on porting a model to an older engine. Having to reduce a 14.5k vertex model to under 9000 was an interesting challenge for me, glad with the final result. There's mouth animations if you use VC ingame. Do hope you enjoy!


Vertices:		8,955
Faces:			17.457
Teamplay colours:	no
Chrome:			no
Animations:		default Sven Co-op (extracted from the Gordon Playermodel)
Filesize:		1.84Mb


Feel free to use this on your servers. Just don't use for your own mods without crediting me as having ported it first, and Hi Rez Studios for creating the original model and design.


Extract the 'models' folder inside Sven_Co-ops folder to ../svencoop_addon/
				    or alternatively     ../svencoop/
