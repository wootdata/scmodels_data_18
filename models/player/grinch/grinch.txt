* Construction *

Poly Count              : 849 faces

Skin Count              : 1 (the eyes are team colored)

Editor used             : 
		Modeling - Milkshape 1.1	
		Skin - Photoshop

Known Bugs              : The skel didn't like the crotch area, so when 			  you crouch the legs are a bit messed up.  			  Also since the team color sliders are 			  reversed just make sure the 2 sliders are 			  above each other(not my fault!).


Thanks			: Dr. Seuss my favorite author, whoever made 			  the movie, Valve, Mete with Milkshape, 			  Scarecrow for the tuts, ~A.U.S.T.I.N. for the 			  help, my bro for his support, and everyone 			  else

	*The Grinch is the creation of Dr. Seuss.*
	This is my first ppm for anything.
	Maybe if people like this I will do the Cat soon.
	Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
